# Individual Contribution – Predictive Analytics Case Competition (Churn)

This case competition focused on predicting customer churn and translating model insights into clear, business-ready recommendations. My individual contribution emphasized modeling, evaluation, and turning results into actionable retention strategy.

## 1) What did I personally contribute to the most?

I contributed most to the **modeling and evaluation** work.  
I built and compared churn models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Boosting-style, and CatBoost), focusing on ROC-AUC performance and interpretability for business use.

## 2) What is one decision or approach I personally advocated for and why?

I advocated for starting with a **business-driven feature set** before adding complexity.  
This kept the model explainable, reduced leakage risk, and ensured recommendations connected to real retention levers.

## 3) Lessons learned + what I would improve with more time

**Lessons learned:**  
Strong models matter, but the real value comes from converting predictions into clear, measurable actions.

**With more time:**  
I would tune models more systematically, add probability calibration + threshold optimization, and strengthen segmentation using churn risk + customer value together.
