# Individual Contribution — Case Competition (Predictive Analytics)

## What I personally contributed to the most
I contributed most heavily to the segmentation and recommendation portion of the project. I helped translate model outputs into clear customer segments and business actions, and I focused on communicating the results in a way that non-technical stakeholders could understand.

## One decision or approach I personally advocated for (and why)
One approach I advocated for was treating segmentation as a business tool, not just a technical clustering exercise. Instead of only describing clusters statistically, I pushed for connecting each segment to a clear strategy, expected KPI impact, and trade-offs (for example, margin erosion risk from discounts). This made the final recommendations more realistic and executive-ready.

## Lessons learned + what I would improve with more time
One key lesson was that the best model is not always the best business solution — recommendations must balance churn reduction with profitability and operational feasibility. If I had more time, I would improve the project by validating the recommendations with an A/B testing plan and deeper sensitivity analysis to estimate ROI under different offer costs and customer behaviors.
